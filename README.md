## The problem

You have a folder. Maybe it's a project, a client, a trip, a course. Inside — files. But you open it a month later and think: What was this about? What did I decide? What's next?

The context is gone. It was in your head, in some chat, in an email you'll never find.

## The solution

4Fo adds a tiny file to your folder — like a sticky note on a box. Open it and you see a feed of your notes, voice memos, screenshots, links. Like messaging yourself about this folder.

```
My Project/
├── 4.fo          ← your context
├── contract.pdf
├── notes.md
└── assets/
```

Move the folder — stickers go with it. No database. No account. No sync.

## What you can add

- **Text notes** — "Client wants changes by Friday"
- **Voice memos** — quick thoughts while you work
- **Screenshots** — references, mockups, inspiration
- **File links** — point to related files anywhere
- **Web links** — save URLs with context
- **Folder snapshot** — list of files at this moment

## Install

Requires macOS 15+ and Apple Silicon.

1. Download and unzip
2. Move 4Fo.app to Applications
3. If macOS blocks it: right-click → Open → Open

## Creating sticker boards

Three ways:

**Quick Action** — Run "Install Quick Action.app" once. Then right-click any folder → Quick Actions → New Sticker Board

**From the app** — Open 4Fo → File → New (⌘N) → Save to your folder

**Manually** — Create an empty file named `4.fo` in any folder. Double-click to open

## Keyboard shortcuts

- `⌘N` — new board
- `⌘Enter` — save sticker
- `Esc` — cancel editing
